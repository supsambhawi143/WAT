    <h1>Fundamentals of CSS</h1>
    <h3><bold>Cascading</bold></h3>
    <p1>
        Style can be added as an inline element using the style attribute on 
        tags as is the case for this paragraph. Here font-weight has been given
        a weight of 800.
    </p1><br/><br/>
    <p><p2>
        The inline style takes precedent over all other style <br/>declarations. 
        Next in order of prcedent is the embeded<br/> style. The uses style tags and is 
        often found in the <br/>header section of a page. This pre tag is styled with <br/>
        embeded style. An extra large green font.
    </p2></p>
    <p7>
        Ideally style is held seperate to structure in a style sheet. Other than the 2 examples
        above all other style on this page is in a seperate style sheet. Including the change of
        base font to Arial.
    </p7><br/><br/>
    <p3>Selectors</p3><br/><br/>
    <p4>
        CSS selectors are used to apply style. There is the element selector, class selector and 
        id selector. All being well you have used an elememt selector to modify the font on this 
        page by adding style to the body tag in your attatched  style sheet. Words in this <span id="word"
        style="color:purple;letter-spacing:10px;">sentence</span> have been <span id="word"
        style="color:purple;letter-spacing:10px;">styled</span>  using a class selector applied 
        to letter-spacing and the heading for this section with an id selector.
    </p4><br/>

    <h3>Box Model </h3>

    <div class="box">
        <div class="one"><a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/">https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/</a></div>
        <div class="two"><a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/">https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/</a></div>
        <div class="three"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">https://www.w3schools.com/</a></div>
    </div><br/>

    <p5>
        The links above are held in a list that is re-styled to remove list-style-type and display inline. 
        Padding, margin and borxer are then added as appropriate.
    </p5>
    <h3>Layout</h3>
    <div class="box1">
        <div class="first">These words are in column 1</div>
        <div class="second">These words are in column 2</div>
        <div class="third">These words are in column 3</div>
    </div><br/>
    <p6>
        Margin,padding,borders and floats added to achieve this layout of columns.
